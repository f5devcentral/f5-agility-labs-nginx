Exercise 1.2: Configure nginx-manager
#####################################

Objective
=========

Configure NGINX Instance Manager to run securely.  To secure ``nginx-manager`` 
you will configure NGINX as a proxy server.  You can utilize all your NGINX 
knowledge since ``nginx-manager`` is simply a web application.

.. note::
   
   Don't worry if you are a little rusty with NGINX.  We will walk you through
   all the steps here and also show you where some sample conf files are for 
   when you use ``nginx-manager`` in your own environment.


Guide
=====

Step 1: Edit the nginx-manager.conf file
----------------------------------------

We need to open and edit the nginx-manager.conf file.  Use ``vim`` or your favorite 
editor open the file ``nginx-manager.conf`` in the ``/etc/nginx-manager`` directory.

.. code-block:: shell-session

   [centos@nginx-manager ~]$ sudo vim /etc/nginx-manager/nginx-manager.conf

.. note::

   ``vim`` and ``nano`` are available on the control node, as well as
   Visual Studio and Atom via RDP

Step 2: Inspect the configuration file
--------------------------------------

Enter or edit the following options for ``nginx-manager.conf``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   #
   # /etc/nginx-manager/nginx-manager.conf
   #

   # Configuration file for NGINX Compass Server

   # bind address for all service ports (default "localhost")
   bind-address: 127.0.0.1
   # gRPC service port for agent communication (default "10000")
   grpc-port: 10000
   # gRPC-gateway service port for API and UI (default "11000")
   gateway-port: 11000

   # SSL CN or servername for certs
   server-name: nginx-manager.f5demolab.com
   # path to x.509 certificate file (optional)
   cert: /etc/ssl/nginx-manager/nginx-manager.crt
   # path to x.509 certificate key file (optional)
   key: /etc/ssl/nginx-manager/nginx-manager.key

   # set log level (panic, fatal, error, info, debug, trace; default: info) (default "info")
   log:
      level: info
      path: /var/log/nginx-manager/
   # Metrics default storage path (default "/tmp/metrics") (directory must be already present)
   metrics:
      storage-path: /var/nginx-manager/
   # Path to license file
   license: /etc/nginx-manager/nginx-manager.lic

-  ``bind-address:`` is ``127.0.0.1`` by default but could be changed
   to ``0.0.0.0`` to listen on all ports. This is insecure and provides no
   protection though.
-  ``grpc-port:`` is for the agent and server communication.
-  ``gateway-port:`` is used by humans, API calls and the metrics. It is
   the port you access the UI and API.

-  ``server-name:`` is the server name presented to clients and is needed 
   for proper TLS operations.  It should match the CN on the certificate 
   used with ``nginx-manager``.
-  The ``cert:`` and ``key:`` options are for the PEM encoded certifiate and 
   private key for TLS encryption.

-  ``level:`` under ``log:`` allows specifying the logging level for ``nginx-manager``.
-  ``path:`` under ``log:`` is the location of the log files for ``nginx-manager``.

-  ``storage-path:`` under ``metrics:`` is the location of the database and 
   metrics directory.
-  ``license:`` is the location of the ``nginx-manager`` license file.

- ``audit-log:`` is not show by default.  Adding it with a path to the audit log file
   will enable audit logging.  Every API call will be logged and ``nginx-manager``
   uses headers to log the username and role.  This feature will be better explained once
   a grouping mechanism is added.  For now, don't add the option unless you need audit 
   logging.

Confirm the nginx-manager.conf file is like the example above.  We have a public 
certificate and key for use in the ``/etc/nginx-manager/`` directory.

Step 3: Inspect the service
---------------------------

We are using systemd for the service management with ``nginx-manager``.  
We actually use pleaserun to automatically detect the service manager at
installation which helps reduce the packages we use (we only have 2 right
now, amd64 for rpm and for deb).

Let's take a look at the files included in the package we installed before
we enable the service.  Note the various files included for the different 
service managers.  We can also see includes that are placed in the 
``/usr/share`` directory for examples, support and license information.

Centos 7 and most modern systems use systemd.  Systemd allows additional 
settings to be made.  We can look at the systemd settings by using the 
following command below.  Note the override settings.  You can adjust the 
restart periods by editing that file if desired.

.. code-block:: shell-session

   [centos@nginx-manager ~]$ sudo systemctl cat nginx-manager.service
      # /etc/systemd/system/nginx-manager.service
      [Unit]
      Description=nginx-manager

      [Service]
      Type=simple
      User=root
      Group=root
      # Load env vars from /etc/default/ and /etc/sysconfig/ if they exist.
      # Prefixing the path with '-' makes it try to load, but if the file doesn't
      # exist, it continues onward.
      EnvironmentFile=-/etc/default/nginx-manager
      EnvironmentFile=-/etc/sysconfig/nginx-manager
      ExecStart=/usr/sbin/nginx-manager "/usr/sbin/ngxscan"
      Restart=always
      WorkingDirectory=/var/nginx-manager/

      # When stopping, how long to wait before giving up and sending SIGKILL?
      # Keep in mind that SIGKILL on a process can cause data loss.
      TimeoutStopSec=15

      [Install]
      WantedBy=multi-user.target

      # /etc/systemd/system/nginx-manager.service.d/override.conf
      [Service]
      Restart=on-failure
      RestartSec=5
      TimeoutStopSec=15

Step 4: Enable and start the service
------------------------------------

To enable the service to run at startup we will enable the systemd service.
We can also start the service with one command at the same time.  The command 
below is the equivalent of running ``systemctl enable nginx-manager`` followed 
by ``systemctl start nginx-manager``.

.. code-block:: shell-session

   [centos@nginx-manager ~]$ sudo systemctl enable nginx-manager --now


Step 5: Verify NGINX Instance Manager is running
------------------------------------------------

Check that the service is now enable and running.

.. code-block:: shell-session

   [centos@nginx-manager ~]$ sudo systemctl is-enabled nginx-manager
   enabled
   [centos@nginx-manager ~]$ sudo systemctl status nginx-manager
   ● nginx-manager.service - nginx-manager
      Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/nginx-manager.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
      Drop-In: /etc/systemd/system/nginx-manager.service.d
               └─override.conf
      Active: active (running) since Sat 2021-03-20 15:45:11 UTC; 1 day 20h ago
      Main PID: 570 (nginx-manager)
      CGroup: /system.slice/nginx-manager.service
               └─570 /usr/sbin/nginx-manager /usr/sbin/ngxscan
