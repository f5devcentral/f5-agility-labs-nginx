Exercise 1.3: Discover new instances
####################################

Objective
=========

Discover new instances using the scan function of NGINX Instance 
Manager.

Guide
=====

The lab environment contains 5 instances of NGINX (not including the 
repository server and the nginx-manager server). We will use the ``ngxscan`` 
to discover the instances and list CVE information.

The scan uses NMAP stealth scan to look at ports the web servers or load balancers 
listen on.  This is an optional component of nginx-manager but can be useful to 
keep track of NGINX instances since we can also call the function through an API. 
For this exercise, we will use the user interface to run the scan.

Step 1:
-------

Navigate to the UDF dashboard for the lab and open the NGINX Manager instance, selecting 
the ``Instance Manager UI`` option under ``ACCESS``.
