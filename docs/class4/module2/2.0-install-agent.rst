Exercise 2.0: Installing NGINX Agent
####################################

Objective
=========

Install the ``nginx-agent`` on multiple instances and configure 
the agent to work with existing NGINX instances and ``nginx-manager``

Guide
=====

Installation of `NGINX Agent <https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-instance-manager/getting-started/agent/>`__ 
follows a process that is very similar to installing 
`NGINX Plus <https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/installing-nginx-plus/>`__.

Step 1
------

Navigate to the ``nginx-manager`` instance as ``centos`` and use the home directory.

Use the SSH menu option to beceome the centos user.  If you use the web-shell it 
defaults to the root user.  To follow best practice, please use the centos user.

If prompted, select yes for trusting the ssh connection in your terminal.

.. image:: ../module1/UDF-ssh.png

.. code-block:: shell-session

   [centos@nginx-manager ~]$ pwd
   /home/centos

Step 2: Investigate the automation script
-----------------------------------------

Look at the ``reset.sh`` script in the local directory.

.. code-block:: shell-session

   [centos@nginx-manager ~]$ less reset.sh

Look at the ``install-agent()`` section in particular.
There are a number of activities going on.  We are looping through each 
nginx instance by number and performing several actions

- copying a custom ``nginx-agent.conf`` file to the home directory of the instance
- creating ``/etc/ssl/nginx-manager`` if it doesn't exist
- copying the CA certificate and the specific nginx certificate and key for mTLS
- installing the ``nginx-agent`` package
- moving the custom ``nginx-agent.conf`` to the correct location and name
- moving the certificate and private key and saving them as ``agent.crt`` and ``agent.key`` in the ``/etc/ssl/nginx-manager/`` directory.
- enabling the ``nginx-agent`` service and starting the ``nginx-agent`` service

Step 3: Automate the installation of nginx-agent
------------------------------------------------

It's time to run the script.  From the centos home directory run the following and notice 
how the script loops through each instance performing the functions from Step 2.

.. code-block:: shell-session

   [centos@nginx-manager ~]$ ./reset.sh install-agent

Wait for the script to end and the ``nginx-agent`` should be installed and running on four instances.

Step 4: Navigate to NGINX Manager user interface in UDF
-------------------------------------------------------

Navigate to the Inventory page and look for the four instances we added in Exercise 2.0.

.. image:: ./UI-inventory-list.png

Notice how we have columns that show Hostname and Type. 
Our instances are named according to the Operating System and NGINX type they run.

Let's focus on ``OSS-Centos`` which is running NGINX Open Source and Centos 7.

Step 5: Look at details of an NGINX instance 
--------------------------------------------

Click the Hostname of the instance ``OSS-Centos`` and a panel on the right side of the screen will appear with more information on the instance.

.. image:: ./UI-details.png

Click outside the window to return to the inventory list.
