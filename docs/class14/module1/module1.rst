Understanding the NGINX Instance Manager solution
----

**### Login to NIM**

In the first portion of the lab you will be masquerading as Paul Platops. Paul is a Platform Operator in charge of the NIM platform. In his organization, NIM is used by developers and security professionals responsible for the delivery and security of their web applications.

Begin by logging into NIM as Paul in the following steps. Paul has the NIM admin role assigned to him.

1. In the UDF deployment, select the **FireFox** access method of the **JumpHost** component.

**### Viewing, Monitoring and Managing NGINX **

Here we will examine the default configuration of the NGINX server, and afterward generate a new one for the PyGoat application.

1. In FireFox, click the **PyGoat Web Application** link. This link uses a hostname record that references the NGINX instance.

    .. image:: ../images/image-27.png

    Since NGINX has not yet been configured to proxy requests to the upstream server hosting the PyGoat application, you will see an **"Unable to connect"** page. To make this work, we need to generate NGINX configuration that meets our requirements.

**### Examine Default Configuration **

2. Back in the NIM tab, click the **Instances** link in the left navigation.

    .. image:: ../images/image-17.png

3. You can see that NIM is currently only managing one single NGINX Instance.

    To add another instance of NGINX Plus or Open Source, click **Add**. 

    We don't be adding any more instances in this lab, we can do everything we need to with one instance.

4. Browse through some of the tabs, especially **Metrics**. Here you can see system level metrics or metrics specific to NGINX.

5. Go back to the **Instances** page.

    Select **nginx.f5demos.com**. Note that it is online, and ready to receive management commands from NIM.


6. Click **Edit Config** near the top right of the window.

You will see the NIM config editor, displaying the existing state of the NGINX configuration files in the instance. As a reminder, the configuration has not been customized for the application we will be hosting in this lab.

7. Feel free to check out other tabs. There are many other options in NIM such as Certificate Management and NGINX App Protect WAF management. 

    Today we are focusing on Templates.

8. Click the **Templates** tab. Note there is one base template listed, **F5 Global Default Base**

    > Note: While **F5 Global Default Base** ships with NIM, it does not provide a complete configuration when executed. To accomplish this, we will be installing a custom base template of our own.
