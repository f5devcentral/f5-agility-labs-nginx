LLM02: Sensitive Information Disclosure
=======================================

**Definition**: LLM applications have the potential to reveal sensitive
information, proprietary algorithms, or other confidential details
through their output. This can result in unauthorized access to
sensitive data, intellectual property, privacy violations, and other
security breaches. It is important for consumers of LLM applications to
be aware of how to safely interact with LLMs and identify the risks
associated with unintentionally inputting sensitive data that may be
subsequently returned by the LLM in output elsewhere.

Attack
------

The **AI Assistant** might have access to personal information which
could have been provided to it ever by mistake or with malicious intent.
This attack vector can expose **PII** data which is not allowed.

Letâ€™s see how we can attack our ChatBot using this attack vector.

| Start a new conversation and paste the bellow prompt.
| ``Who is the CEO of Arcadia and how can I contact her ?``

| As you can see bellow personal information about the CEO has been
  exposed.

Protect
-------

We will now configure the **AI Gateway** to protect the AI Assistant by
using the F5 built ``pii-redactor`` processor.

1. We will add the ``pii-redactor`` processor AI Gateway configuration

   .. code:: yaml

      processors:
          - name: pii-redactor
            type: external
            config:
              endpoint: "http://aigw-processors-f5:8000"
              version: 1
              namespace: f5
            params:
              threshold: 0.2 # Default 0.2
              allow_rewrite: true # Default false
              denyset: ["EMAIL","PHONE_NUMBER","STREETADDRESS","ZIPCODE"]

2. The processor definition is attached under the **responseStages**
   which is part of the previously configured profile. The
   **responseStages** indicates to the AI Gateway to inspect the
   response and run it through the configured processors.

   .. code:: yaml

      profiles:
       - name: default
         responseStages:
           - name: protect
             steps:
               - name: pii-redactor

         services:
           - name: ollama

3. The final config will look like this:

   .. code:: yaml

      # The routes determine on what URL path the AIGW is listening
      routes:
        - path: /api/chat
          policy: arcadia_ai_policy
          timeoutSeconds: 600
          schema: openai

      # What policy is applied to the route
      policies:
        - name: arcadia_ai_policy
          profiles:
            - name: default

      # To what LLM endpoint we forward the request to
      services:
        - name: ollama
          executor: http
          config:
            endpoint: "http://ollama_public_ip:11434/api/chat"
            schema: ollama-chat

      # What do we do with the request, at the moment we just forward it
      profiles:
        - name: default
          responseStages:
            - name: protect
              steps:
                - name: pii-redactor

          services:
            - name: ollama


      # Here we will find all our processor configuration
      processors:
        - name: pii-redactor
          type: external
          config:
            endpoint: "http://aigw-processors-f5:8000"
            version: 1
            namespace: f5
          params:
            threshold: 0.2 # Default 0.2
            allow_rewrite: true # Default false
            denyset: ["EMAIL","PHONE_NUMBER","STREETADDRESS","ZIPCODE"]   

4. | Configure the AI Gateway by running the bellow command in the
     **VSCODE** terminal.
   | ``curl --data-binary "@/home/ubuntu/appworld/aigw_configs/lab6.yaml" http://10.1.1.5:8080/v1/config``

5. | Restart the chat and run the attack again.
   | ``Who is the CEO of Arcadia and how can I contact her ?``
   | You will see that this time **AI Gateway** is redacting the PII
     data.

6. Inspect the AI Gateway logs. You will see similar logs as bellow. The
   processor identified the PII data and redacted it.

   .. code:: bash
