Lab 1.2 - UDF pattern systems walk through
==========================================

This lab will be primarily instructor led discussion and Q&A about the UDF pattern, to help familiierize you with the patterns elements. Feel free to look around.

.. important::
   While you are encouraged to explore it is not recomended that any configuraiton changes are made. The only real interactions we will have with the UDF pattern at this stage is to access XRDP in the "control / dev" system.
   
Once we have had a chance to discuss the pattern we will complete the short set of steps bleow to access the "control / dev" system.

   #. Locate and click on the components tab in the center of the screen
   #. Locate the sytem "control / dev"
   #. From the Access drop down menu click the down arrow and slect XRDP.

.. note::
   This will attempt to launch an RDP session on the system.
   
.. important::
   On Windows and Mac this should happen automatically on linx you will need to have an RDP client installed such as Remina to access the RDP session. This is a prerequisite of the course.

Recap
-----
You now have the following:

   - Explored the UDP Pattern.
   - Gone through the important elements with the instructor.
   - Accessed the "control / dev" sytem via RDP.

Next we'll explore the control / dev system where we will be conducting most of our work.
