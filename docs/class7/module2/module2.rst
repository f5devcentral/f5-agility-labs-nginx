Module 2: Standing up the Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE)
=========================================================

In this module you will walk through the configuration of the cluster.yaml and the deployment of Rancher's Kubernetes Engine. We will first cover the different parts of the cluster.yaml and then we will add a minimal set of changes to a new version of the file that will be used to stand up the RKE cluster.

.. note::
    This install is a bare bones installation of RKE. This will give us a solid foundation for our K8s cluster. For the purposes of this demo we will be leaving out components that are critical for a production cluster, however those can be layered in at any time in the future.
