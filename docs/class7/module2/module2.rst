Module 2: Using the provided GitHub GIST you will Stand up the Rancher Kubernetes Engine 2 (RKE2) and deploy NGINX Ingress Controller
=========================================================

In this module you will follow the instructions in a GitHub GIST to configure and  deploy Rancher's Kubernetes Engine 2 (RKE 2). We will first cover the different parts of the Clusster Manager interface and then we will use the Rancher Manager to stand up the RKE 2 cluster. Once the cluster is active we will deploy a light weight load balancing solution and finally install the NGINX Kubernetes Ingress Controller.

.. note::
    This install is a bare bones installation of RKE 2. This will give us a solid foundation for our K8s cluster.
