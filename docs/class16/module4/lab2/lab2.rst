Testing the App Security
########################

We will go through testing steps to verify that our application has been successfully protected.

.. _Arcadia XSS Attack: http://arcadia-re-.lab-sec.f5demos.com/?a=<script>

1. Let's test the **Web Application Firewall**, browse to `Arcadia XSS Attack`_.  

   The request will be blocked due to the XSS attack by the **Web Application Firewall**.

2. Test the **API protection**:

   a) Browse to `Arcadia non existing endpoint <http://arcadia-re-$$makeId$$.lab-sec.f5demos.com/v1/api>`_.      

      The request will be blocked because the **Path** is not defined in the enforced OpenAPI schema.  

   b) In the **Jumphost** **Webshell** run the bellow cURL command.  

      The request will be blocked because the **email** is defined OpenAPI schema as a string and not as a number.  

      .. code-block:: none

         curl -H "Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8" \
           --data-raw "{\"email\":112233,\"password\":\"bitcoin\"}" \
           http://arcadia-re-$$makeId$$.lab-sec.f5demos.com/v1/login        

3. Test that the **ChatBot** is protected from mallicious Bots. In the **Jumphost** **Webshell** run the bellow cURL commands.  

   Bot protection will block the request as it understands that this request is coming from a **Bot**.  

   .. code-block:: none

     # Login and get JWT token
     JWT_TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST "http://arcadia-re-$$makeId$$.lab-sec.f5demos.com/v1/login" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{"email":"sorin@nginx.com","password":"nginx"}' \
         | grep -o '"jwt":"[^"]*' | cut -d'"' -f4)

     echo "JWT Token: $JWT_TOKEN"

     # Send a message to AI chat
     curl -s -X POST "http://arcadia-re-$$makeId$$.lab-sec.f5demos.com/v1/ai/chat" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
         -d '{"newQuestion":"Tell me about the current market trends for cryptocurrencies."}'
