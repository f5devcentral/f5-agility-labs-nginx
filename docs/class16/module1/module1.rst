During the lab we will access multiple resources. The next step will present the login process and how to access the relevant lab environments.  

We will need to access:

1. **UDF lab environment** where our application is deployed
2. **F5 Distributed Cloud** console which will help us to protect our application


**Module 1 - All sections**
