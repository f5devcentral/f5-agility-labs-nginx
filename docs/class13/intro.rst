introduction
------------

Let's get familiar with the components in UDF, we will explore the following in more detail:

- UDF itself
- GitLabs console
- ArgoCD UI
- N+ instances shell
- Grafana dashboards for NAP

Module 2: 

You will launch a simulated attack on a “standard” or default policy NAP & observe telemetry\

- After each policy type flow has been completed. Have students answer the following questions for each policy type's behavior:
- What are some key insights? What is working well; not working well (false positives vs comprehensive coverage)?
- Students edit policy files and improve on the yaml to add future optimizations
- Observe new behavior: What changed?

Module 3: 

After using Module 2 above, we will dive deeper into some DoS attacks against NGNIX NAP
