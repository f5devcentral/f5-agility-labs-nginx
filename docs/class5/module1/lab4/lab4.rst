7. NGINX App Protect redirected us to this page. Notice that a **support ID** is generated when the page loads. We can use this ID to identify the cause of the image block. **Select and copy this value** so that we can search for it in NMS-SM.

8. Return to NGINX Security Monitoring by clicking the **NMS** bookmark, logging in with username **lab** and password **Agility2023!** and selecting **Security Monitoring**.

12.  Once the security event has loaded, you can see details surrounding the violation that is blocking images on your app.

14.  If you scroll down to the **Attack Details** section, you can expand the individual sections showing **Violations**, **Subviolations**, **CVEs**, and **Threat Campaigns**.

14. Notice that the **Violations** section shows a single violation: **Illegal File Type**. 

.. image:: images/NMS-SM_support_id_illegal_file_type.png

15. We need to allow JPG files to enable our application to operate properly. In order to do so, we need to modify our WAF policy. Let's start that process by navigating back to **Instance Manager** from the **Select module** drop-down at the top of the left menu bar.

.. image:: images/menu_drop_down_nim.png

16. Inside of the **Instance Manager** dashboard, click on **App Protect** towards the bottom of the left menu bar.

17. Click on the **AgilityPolicy** in the policy list. 

.. image:: images/nim_app_protect_agilitypolicy.png

18. Now, click on the **Policy Versions** sub-tab inside of the **Policy Detail** page.

19. Click on the version name under the **Versions** column in the list.

.. image:: images/nim_app_protect_agilitypolicy_version_view.png

20. The JSON configuration of the policy will be displayed, as shown below:
  
.. image:: images/nap_agilitypolicy_json.png

21. To modify the policy based on this version of the policy, click **Edit Version**. 

.. image:: images/nap_agilitypolicy_edit_version.png

22.  Provide a description of the changes you'll be making in the **Description** field. 

.. image:: images/nap_agilitypolicy_version_edit.png

23. Place your mouse cursor inside the policy editor. Press **CTRL+F** to open the search dialog.

.. image:: images/nim_app_protect_agilitypolicy_version_search.png

22. Search for **"jpg"** and you'll find on line 240 that JPG files are not being allowed. Modify line 241 to change **"allowed": false** to **"allowed": true**. Note that false and true are not encapsulated in quotation marks.

.. image:: images/nim_app_protect_agilitypolicy_version_modified.png

23. Click the **Save New Version** button to create a new version of the policy.

30. Notice that the version listed in the **Policy Version** column is in a drop-down box. You may need to hover your mouse arrow over this section to see the drop-down appear.

.. image:: images/policy_version_dropdown.png

31. Change this to your newer version (compare timestamps) and click **Publish**. 

.. image:: images/publish.png

32.  A pop-up will confirm that you have changed the version.

.. image:: images/publish_confirmation.png

33. Click X to close the confirmation window.

37.  Look for the deployment status in the **Last Deployment Details** section. You should see a status of **Finalized**. If not, wait a few moments for the deployment to commence and complete. You may need to refresh your browser for the status to update.

**Deployment not finished**

.. image:: images/deployment_status_unknown.png

**Deployment finished**

.. image:: images/deployment_status.png

30.  Once the deployment has finished, check the site to see if the issue is remediated. In a new tab in **Firefox**, open a new tab and click on the **Arcadia Finance (N+)** bookmark. Notice that the images are now loading successfully.

.. caution:: You may need to hold **Shift** and click the **Reload** icon in the browser to force the browser to fully reload the page.

Now that you have viewed, diagnosed and remedied a false positive in a WAF policy, let's continue to the next section of the lab.
