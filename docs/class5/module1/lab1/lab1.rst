9. Each instance of this lab runs in a virtual environment. Since new VMs are deployed for each instance, the operating system identifiers change, so each NGINX Plus instance is treated as a new instance. Thus, you may see previous instances listed. **Delete only the Offline instances by clicking the three dot icon under the Actions column and selecting Delete**, as shown in the image below.

.. warning:: Do not delete the active instance at the top of the list!
