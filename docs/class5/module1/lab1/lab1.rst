View the NGINX Plus Instance in NMS
===================================

1. Navigate to **Applications** on the menu bar and launch **Firefox**.

.. note:: Be patient as our lab resources are finite. It may take several seconds for Firefox to launch the first time.

2. In Firefox, click on the **Acardia Finance (N+)** bookmark or navigate to **https://nginx-plus.arcadia-finance.io/**. You should see the application page load as shown below.

3. This web application is being proxied by an NGINX Plus instance running NGINX App Protect WAF. This instance is being managed by NGINX Management Suite. Let's take a look at NMS to view the configuration and instance/application metrics. Click on the **NMS** bookmark in Firefox or navigate to **https://nginx-mgmt-suite.agility.lab/ui/**. You'll be presented with the NMS login page. Click ***Sign In***.

.. note:: Each instance of this lab runs in a virtual environement. Since new VMs are deployed for each instance, the operating system identifiers change, so each NGINX Plus instance is treated as a new instance. Thus, you may see previous instances listed. You may optionally delete these **Offline** instances by clicking the three dot icon under the **Actions** column and selecting **Delete**. They will not interfere with the lab.

7. Click on the **nginx-instance-1.agility.lab** instance in the list that shows **Online** under the **Status** column. The **Instance Detail** screen loads.

10. Scroll down through the **Host Details**, **Disk Partitions**, **Network Interfaces** and **Processors** sections to see additional details. 

11. Next, click on the **Metrics Summary** tab. In this tab, you can see visualized metrics around instance resource utiliation, including CPU, memory, overall connection counts, HTTP connection counts and more.

12. Finally, click on the **Metrics** tab to drill-down into the component-level, real-time values of all metrics available for the instance. Click through the sub-tabs, such as **System**, **HTTP Server Zones** and **HTTP Upstreams**. These graphs provide a quick way to identify anomalies in load and performance.
