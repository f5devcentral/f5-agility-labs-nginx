Let's take a look at NMS to view the configuration and instance/application metrics. Click on the **NMS** bookmark in Firefox or navigate to **https://nginx-mgmt-suite.agility.lab/ui/**. You'll be presented with the NMS login page. Click ***Sign In***.

7.  Each instance of this lab runs in a virtual environment. Since new VMs are deployed for each instance, the operating system identifiers change, so each NGINX Plus instance is treated as a new instance. Thus, you may see previous instances listed. **Delete only the  Offline instances by clicking the three dot icon under the Actions column and selecting Delete**, as shown in the image below.

.. warning:: Do not delete the active instance at the top of the list!

13. Finally, click on the **Metrics** tab to drill-down into the component-level, real-time values of all metrics available for the instance. Click through the sub-tabs, such as **System**, **HTTP Server Zones** and **HTTP Upstreams**. These graphs provide a quick way to identify anomalies in load and performance.
