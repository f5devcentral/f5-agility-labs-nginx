Module 1 - Deploy modern application with modern tools
######################################################

In this class, we will deploy a modern application (Arcadia Finance app) with modern tools in a modern environment.

What are modern tools:
   - Ansible
   - Terraform
   - Gitlab and Gitlab CI

What is a modern environment:
   - Kubernetes
   - Docker containers with docker registry

.. note:: Don't be afraid if you don't know those tools. The goal of the lab is not to learn how to deploy them, but how to use them.
