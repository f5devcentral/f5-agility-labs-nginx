Lab 1: Make new code commit, push changes to a live running NGINX Plus Virtual Machine
======================================================================================

This task will walkthrough steps to configuring and pushing new NGINX
features to a live running NGINX Plus Virtual Machine. In this example
we will enable Rate limiting to our Appster service

1. Open **GitHub Desktop Client** and switch to the **Current
   repository** to **“appster-lb”.** From here we can open the Project
   using the “**Open in Visual Studio Code**” button

   .. image:: ../images/image2.png

2. Open ``www.appster.com.conf`` and enable the rating limiting rule:

   Rate-limiting has been preconfigured in this file and is
   **commented out** (**disabled**). To enable rate-limiting, uncomment
   the following lines:

   Uncomment the line with
   the \ `limit_req <https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_limit_req_module.html#limit_req>`__ directive,
   found near the top of the file, this is in the \ ``http`` context,
   outside the ``server`` context and change the ``10000`` to ``10``:

   .. code-block:: ini

      # Rate limit
      # Uncomment lines below to enable here
      limit_req $binary_remote_addr zone=limit_me:1m rate=10000r/s;

   This line defines our rate-limiting rule:

   - **key** - A parameter used to differentiate
     one client from another, typically stored as a variable. In this case we are
     using the client’s IP address, \ ``$binary_remote_addr`` . Note that
     this variable holds the binary representation of an IP address which
     is  *smaller than* ``$remote_addr``
   - **shared memory zone** - The name and size of the zone that stores the
     state of each key using the “`leaky
     bucket <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket>`__”, algorithm. We have
     named it ``limit_me`` with a size of 1 megabyte ``1m`` which can
     store about 16,000 IP addresses (4 bytes for IPv4 addresses, stored
     state occupies 128 bytes on 64-bit platforms.)
   - **rate** - The number of requests per second
     (\`**r/s\`**) or requests per minute (\ ``r/m``). It is initially
     set to ``10000r/s`` but we changed it to ``10r/s``

3. Now we can enable the rate-limiting URL on the root location (``/``).
   In the same file, ``www.appster.com.conf`` , also uncomment the lines
   starting with ``limit_req`` and ``limit_req_status``:

   .. code:: ini

      # Rate limiting
      # Uncomment below to enable here.
      limit_req zone=limit_me;
      limit_req_status 429;

   The directives above apply rate-limiting rules in this location context:

   -  ``limit_req`` - Applies the rate limiting class as defined the zone
      it references, at this location. In this case we enable the rate
      limiting class ``limit_me``
   -  ``limit_conn_status`` - Sets the status code when the rate limit is exceeded.
      ``HTTP 429 "Too many requests"`` will be returned in response to rejected
      requests.

      **Note:** For more info on Limiting Access to Proxied HTTP Resources
      see: `Limiting the Number of
      Connections <https://docs.nginx.com/nginxadmin-guide/security-controls/controlling-access-proxied-http/>`__

      After changes made to ``www.appster.com.conf``, the configuration
      file will look the following:

      .. image:: ../images/image3.png

4. Once you have edited ``www.appster.com.conf`` and uncommented the
   rate limiting directives, go ahead and **save** the file. You can
   navigate to ``file`` -> ``save`` or you can use the shortcut,
   **CTRL+S**.

5. We will see the tracked changes back on the \ **GitHub Desktop
   Client**. In the lower-left of the GitHub, Desktop Client provide a
   **Commit title** and **note** before we can commit to master.

   You can see two boxes. Go ahead and type in the **title** field:
   ``"Enable Rating limiting for Appster.com"``. 

   Additionally, you can provide notes as well, type in the **notes**
   field: ``"Enable 10 request per second in the root '/' location."``

   Once you fill in both boxes, click on **Commit to Master** and on the
   next screen, press **“Push Origin”** to push the new code commit
   to our git repository on Gitlab.

   .. image:: ../images/image4.png

   .. image:: ../images/image5.png

6. Open up the \ **appster-lb** repository on Gitlab by the
   URI, \ `https://gitlab.f5demolab.com/f5-demo-lab/appster-lb <https://gitlab.f5demolab.com/f5-demo-lab/appster-lb>`__
   or using the \ **Appster-lb** shortcut provided so we can view the
   pipeline in progress. (udf/P@ssw0rd20)

   The pipeline is automatically triggered, and we can follow its
   progress by clicking the pipeline status icon on the main repo
   homepage and then pipeline status icon on the commit screen.

   .. image:: ../images/image6.png

   .. image:: ../images/image7.png

   The next screen shows a high-level view of the pipeline triggered for
   this commit. We can click on the pipeline status icon on this screen
   to view the pipeline progress in greater detail.

.. attention:: Stop: This is a good time to inspect the **GitLab CI/CD pipeline file**, 
   `.gitlab-ci.yml <https://gitlab.f5.local/f5-demo-lab/appster-lb/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml>`__,
   while waiting for the pipeline to complete.

   #. Look at stage, ``test_nginx_conf``, and see the first two step with the ``sed`` and ``find``
      command that starts with. These command uncomments this line ``include /etc/nginx/test_env/*.conf``
      in our ``nginx.conf`` file and replaces the placeholder ``${appster_upstream}`` with
      ``http_appster_test`` in our configurations files to enables a test localhost/loopback
      upstream to test against.

   #. Look at stage, ``deploy_to_staging``, and compare to the stage, ``deploy_to_production``,
      Do you see ``when: manual``? This enforces a manual trigger to deploy to production!

   #. In stages, ``deploy_to_staging:`` and ``deploy_to_production`` you can see: ``apk add rsync`` and ``rsync -avrzI ...`` which allow us install the remote sync tool and then later deploy the files
      to the remote servers

7. Eventually, we will see the pipeline complete. At this stage, the
   build and tests have passed, and we are ready to test on our Staging
   server. After QA testing on our Staging environment, we can decide to
   deploy to Production or proceed to fix issues discovered and iterate
   on another code commit

   .. image:: ../images/image9.png

8.  Let’s play QA Engineering and do some testing on our Staging
    environment. View our **Staging** NGINX Plus service in a browser on
    the
    URI, \ `http://docker.f5.local <http://docker.f5.local>`__,
    or use the shortcut, \ **STAGING LB - Appster**

    .. image:: ../images/image10.png

    You will see that rate limiting ten request per second results in
    missing web page content and **broken UI**, worst you may even get a
    ``HTTP 429 Error page``! Not a something we would like to do in
    production obviously!

    .. image:: ../images/image11.png

    Or perhaps the errors look more severe!

    .. image:: ../images/image14.png

9.  If you would like to see the rate limiting rule applied against a
    load test, Open an SSH session using **git bash for windows** to our
    Staging server and run vegeta load tester running the following
    command.

    To open **git bash for windows** again open the **Git Bash** icon on
    the Windows desktop. Git Bash is a bash shell emulator, similar to
    what you see natively on Linux and Unix machines. If the git console
    font is too small to read, use **Ctrl+ “+”** to increase the font

    Once **git bash for windows** is open, run the following command to
    SSH into the Staging server:

    .. code-block:: bash

       ssh centos@10.1.1.11

    .. image:: ../images/image12.png

    On the Staging Server go ahead and run the following command to test
    1000 requests per second against the staging NGINX Plus instance
    servicing our Appster web application:

    .. code-block:: bash

       $ echo "GET http://10.1.1.11" | vegeta attack -rate=1000/s -duration=1s | vegeta report

       Requests [total, rate, throughput] 1000, 1001.47, 10.01
       Duration [total, attack, wait] 998.672ms, 998.536ms, 135.683µs
       Latencies [min, mean, 50, 90, 95, 99, max] 124.393µs, 166.802µs,
       144.693µs, 167.041µs, 179.706µs, 1.133ms, 2.023ms
       Bytes In [total, mean] 349960, 349.96
       Bytes Out [total, mean] 0, 0.00

       Success [ratio] 1.00%
       Status Codes [code:count] 200:10 429:990

       Error Set:
       429 Too Many Requests

    We should see around ten ``HTTP200`` requests and the remainder of
    the request ``HTTP429`` ``"Too many requests"``

10. Play around with the rate-limiting settings until you feel
    comfortable pushing new rate-limiting settings to Production:

    You can edit ``etc/nginx/conf.d/www.appster.com.conf`` live on the
    Staging server terminal, change the ``rate`` parameter to a higher
    number i.e.

    - To edit using ``vim`` run:

    .. code:: bash

       sudo vim /etc/nginx/conf.d/www.appster.com.conf

    - Or ``nano``:

    .. code:: bash

       sudo nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/www.appster.com.conf

    - We can change the rate to something much higher,
       i.e. \ ``10000/rs``

    .. code:: ini

       limit_req $binary_remote_addr zone=limit_me:1m rate=10000r/s;

    - Remember to save changes to our file

       -  In ``vim`` type ``:wq!`` to save and quit
       -  In ``nano`` type ``CTRL+X`` and accept to save changes and
          quit

    If you did make changes, remember to check the nginx configuration
    syntax then reload NGINX with the new config:

    .. code:: bash

       $ sudo nginx -t && sudo nginx -s reload

       nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
       nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful

11. We can now rerun the ``vegeta`` load generator test using the same
    command run in the previous step and view the user experience
    through the web browser

    If you are happy with your testing, we need to commit the new code
    to our git repository, so changes are tracked!

    .. note:: This Staging and Production servers in this lab can handle
       limited load Do not expect more that 800 request per second through
       the load balancer

12. Open ``www.appster.com.conf`` and increase the 10 requests per
    second to 10000 requests per second on our rating limiting rule:

    .. code:: ini

       # Rate limit
       # Uncomment lines below to enable here
       limit_req $binary_remote_addr zone=limit_me:1m rate=10000r/s;

    .. image:: ../images/image15.png

13. Once you have edited ``www.appster.com.conf`` and increased the rate
    limit, go ahead and **save** the file. You can navigate to ``file``
    -> ``save`` or you can use the shortcut, **CTRL+S**.

14. We will see the tracked changes back on the \ **GitHub Desktop
    Client**. In the lower-left of the GitHub, Desktop Client provide a
    **Commit title** and **note** before we can commit to master.

    You can see two boxes. Go ahead and type in the **title** field:
    ``"Enable Rating limiting for Appster.com"``. 

    Additionally, you can provide notes as well, type in the **notes**
    field:
    ``"Enable 10000 request per second in the root '/' location."``

    Once you fill in both boxes, click on **Commit to Master** and on
    the next screen, press **“Push Origin”** to push the new code
    commit to our git repository on Gitlab.

    .. image:: ../images/image16.png

    .. image:: ../images/image5.png

15. Open up the **appster-lb** repository on Gitlab by the URI,
    `https://gitlab.f5demolab.com/f5-demo-lab/appster-lb <https://gitlab.f5demolab.com/f5-demo-lab/appster-lb>`__
    or using the **Appster-lb** shortcut provided so we can view the
    pipeline in progress

    The pipeline is automatically triggered, and we can follow its
    progress by clicking the pipeline status icon on the main repo
    homepage and then pipeline status icon on the commit screen.

    .. image:: ../images/image6.png

    .. image:: ../images/image17.png

    Once our pipeline has completed, our new rate limiting configuration
    is automatically deployed to our Staging server.

    Once again have a quick check on staging or use the load test tool,
    ``vegeta`` once again. Once you have validated the changes we can
    push to production!

16. Remember we have purposely left deployment to Production to a human
    trigger, press the \ **Play button** to deploy the new code to
    Production. We can click on the title to the progress of the
    deployment stage in realtime.

    A \ **green tick** on this stage indicates a successful deployment
    and we are now live in Production!
